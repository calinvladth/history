This project is a personal one and for presentation purposes.

The idea was to find a good and simple way to track my finances.
It started as a one day project that ended up with a 2 week project.

I would be happy to get some feedback about what kind of reports you might find useful in your finances or if you have any other advice that you think I might find interesting, feel free to reach me.

If you have any advice about the experience or you experience errors, please let me know.

I will never use your credentials for marketing purposes.
